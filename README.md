# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component

![screenshot of project](/images/screenshot.png)

### The challenge

The challenge was to creat a 3 column component with buttons that would
convert to a vertical version when presented on different devices with different
screen sizes.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I learned to work with Flexbox to change the layout depending on screen size,
use media queries to carry out the change dependant on a specific width,
and create interactive buttons that change when hovered over.

### Continued development

- Convert style.css to SASS/SCSS format
